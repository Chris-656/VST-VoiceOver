00:00:14,950 --> 00:00:20,150
Yes, welcome to this
tutorial in Redex Champirping.

2
00:00:20,290 --> 00:00:25,681
This third tutorial is
supposed to show you

3
00:00:25,682 --> 00:00:27,434
how to make a texture of

4
00:00:27,458 --> 00:00:29,210
a tree trunk, see here.

5
00:00:29,430 --> 00:00:32,150
On a simple
zilinder, in the middle.

6
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:37,970
We used two textures
here A texture for the trunk.

7
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:43,130
And another texture here
from the slide of the tree trunk.

8
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:45,678
And I'll show you in a few a

9
00:00:45,702 --> 00:00:47,850
few Steps how simple this is

10
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:50,721
possible, here
the texture in the

11
00:00:50,745 --> 00:00:54,170
right place Get help
from the UV-Mapin.

12
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,170
Then we start with the blender default.

13
00:01:00,090 --> 00:01:02,070
The buf is turning here.

14
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,952
I delete the buffet and add a

15
00:01:06,976 --> 00:01:11,071
zilinder to whom
I scalar in Zett.

16
00:01:11,575 --> 00:01:18,190
We see here that we are not closer
to the modeling of the tree stance

17
00:01:18,191 --> 00:01:21,689
and only how we
optimally the Texture

18
00:01:21,713 --> 00:01:25,210
can be in the
middle of this zilinder.

19
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:36,510
Well, we are now looking at the
UV Mapin, The UV-Mapin do tools.

20
00:01:37,010 --> 00:01:40,210
We also see here in
an earlier one Tutorials.

21
00:01:40,990 --> 00:01:46,550
The zilinder
already dubbed here.

22
00:01:46,970 --> 00:01:51,459
We'll see that here
Page of the zilinder and

23
00:01:51,483 --> 00:01:55,971
The upper and the
Underside of the zilinder.

24
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,970
This is the case with the
photo objects If we completely ...
