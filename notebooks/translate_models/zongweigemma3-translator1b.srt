Welcome to this tutorial on
the Texture Mapping series.

2
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:27,830
This third tutorial will show you how to map a texture of

3
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,810
a tree stem you see here to a simple cylinder.

4
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,050
We have used two textures here.

5
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:42,690
One for the stem and another here from the cut of the tree stem.

6
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,430
And I will show you in a few steps how easy it is to do this.

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:53,750
Here the texture to the right place
with help from UV mapping to get.

8
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,650
Then we start with the Blender default screen, here is the cube.

9
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:10,490
I delete the cube and give a cylinder to it, which I scale slightly.

10
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,790
We see here that we are not going to focus on modeling the root of the

11
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:20,153
tree here, but
only on how we can

12
00:01:20,177 --> 00:01:24,910
optimally map the
texture to this cylinder.

13
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:33,370
Good, we are now watching the UV mapping map series.

14
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:39,485
We also see here in one of the earlier tutorials, is

15
00:01:39,509 --> 00:01:46,270
the cylinder already correctly mapped? There, here.

16
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,073
We see the side of the cylinder and

17
00:01:51,097 --> 00:01:55,751
the upper and lower sides of the cylinder.

18
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:58,610
This is the case with default objects.
