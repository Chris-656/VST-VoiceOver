Yes, welcome to this tutorial
in the series of Texture Mapping.

2
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:25,674
This third tutorial is meant to show you how to map a texture

3
00:00:25,698 --> 00:00:31,910
of a tree trunk, which you can see here, onto a simple cylinder.

4
00:00:31,911 --> 00:00:37,123
We have used two textures here, one texture for the

5
00:00:37,147 --> 00:00:42,890
trunk and another texture here from the cut of the tree trunk.

6
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,550
And I'll show you in a few short steps, how easy it is to

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,830
get the texture in the right place with the help of UV Mapping.

8
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,670
Then we start with the Blender default
screen here, the cube.

9
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:10,650
I delete the cube and add a
cylinder, which I scale a bit in the Z direction.

10
00:01:11,575 --> 00:01:16,902
We see here that we will not go into

11
00:01:16,926 --> 00:01:22,630
details
about modeling the tree stump, but

12
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,630
only
about how we can optimally map textures onto this cylinder.

13
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:35,690
Good, we now look at the UV Editing
Tools.

14
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,190
We also see in one of our earlier tutorials,

15
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,050
the cylinder is already correctly mapped.

16
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:52,750
At this point here, we see the side of the cylinder and the top and

17
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:55,490
bottom of the cylinder.

18
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,710
This is the case with default objects.
