Welcome warmly to this tutorial
in<br>the series Texture Mapping.

2
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:27,830
This third tutorial will show you,<br>how to map the texture of a tree

3
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,810
trunk, which you can see here,<br>onto a simple cylinder.

4
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,050
<br>We have used two textures here.

5
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:42,690
<br>One texture for the trunk and
another<br>texture from the cut on the tree trunk.

6
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,430
<br>I will show you in just a few steps,<br>how easy it is to do this.

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:53,750
Here's how to get the texture at the
right place with help from UV Mapping.

8
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,650
Then we start with the Blender Default Screen, here the cube.

9
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:10,490
I delete the cube and give a cylinder instead, which I scale up by Z.

10
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:16,790
We see that now we're not going closer to modeling the tree

11
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:24,910
trunk but only how we can map the texture optimally on this cylinder.

12
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:33,370
Good, let's take a look at the UV Mapping technology.

13
00:01:33,895 --> 00:01:38,325
We also see here in one of the earlier tutorials

14
00:01:38,349 --> 00:01:43,970
that the cylinder is already correctly mapped here.

15
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:45,880
At this point here.

16
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:51,073
We see the side of the cylinder and

17
00:01:51,097 --> 00:01:55,751
the top and bottom sides of the cylinder.

18
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:58,570
This is the case by default for default objects.

19
00:01:59,270 --> 00:02:01,270
However, when we are dealing with completely
