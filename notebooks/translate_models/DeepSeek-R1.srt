Welcome warmly to this tutorial
in the series on Texture Mapping.

2
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:27,830
This third tutorial will show you,
how to apply texture to a tree trunk.

3
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:31,810
Here you can see a simple cylinder that can be mapped.

4
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,050
We have used two textures here.

5
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:42,690
One texture for the trunk and another
texture from the cross-section of the tree trunk.

6
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,430
And I will show you in just a few steps how easy it is to get

7
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:53,750
the texture onto the correct place with help of UV-Mapping.

8
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,650
Starting now, we begin using the default configuration
of Blender on this screen; take a look at the cube here.

9
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:10,490
I delete the cube and give a cylinder instead.

10
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,310
We see here that we are now not

11
00:01:14,334 --> 00:01:18,050
approaching the
modeling of the stump any

12
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:21,541
closer, but rather
focusing on how we can

13
00:01:21,565 --> 00:01:25,551
optimally map the
texture onto this cylinder.

14
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,310
Well...

15
00:01:31,185 --> 00:01:39,510
we now take a look at the UV-mapping
on the... we also see in one of our earlier

16
00:01:39,710 --> 00:01:45,870
Tutorials, if the cylinder is already
correctly mapped at this location here.

17
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:56,951
We see here the side of the cylinder and
the upper and lower surfaces of the cylinder.

18
00:01:57,120 --> 00:01:59,410
This is the case with default objects.
