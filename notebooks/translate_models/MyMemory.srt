00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:20,210
Yes, welcome to this tutorial
in the Texture Mapping series.

2
00:00:20,690 --> 00:00:27,930
This third tutorial is designed to show you
how to create a texture of

3
00:00:27,931 --> 00:00:32,090
a tree trunk that you see here on a simple
Cylinders.

4
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:35,310
We used two textures here.

5
00:00:35,430 --> 00:00:38,876
One texture for the
trunk and another

6
00:00:38,900 --> 00:00:43,210
Texture here from
the cut of the tree trunk.

7
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:45,191
And I'll show you in a few

8
00:00:45,215 --> 00:00:47,730
Steps, how easy
this is possible,

9
00:00:48,110 --> 00:00:51,168
here the texture
to the right place

10
00:00:51,192 --> 00:00:54,070
with Get help from UV mapping.

11
00:00:55,850 --> 00:01:02,070
Then we start with the Blender
Default Screen the cube here.

12
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:06,166
I'm deleting the
Cube and add a

13
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,990
cylinder that
i scale something to Z.

14
00:01:11,790 --> 00:01:17,010
We see here that we are not here now
elaborate on

15
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:21,248
the modelling of the tree stump,
but only on how we

16
00:01:21,249 --> 00:01:25,510
can apply optimal texture to these
Can map cylinders.

17
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:36,110
Good, now let's look at UV editing
Tools.

18
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:40,607
We also see here in one of the earlier

19
00:01:40,608 --> 00:01:44,030
tutorials, the cylinder is already mapped correctly.

20
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:56,250
On and the bottom of the cylinder.

21
00:01:56,490 --> 00:01:58,910
This is the case with default objects.
