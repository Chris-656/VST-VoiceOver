00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,550
Yes, welcome to this tutorial in
the series on Texture Mapping.

2
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,058
This third tutorial is meant

3
00:00:24,082 --> 00:00:27,870
to show you how you can map a

4
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:29,718
tree trunk texture, which you

5
00:00:29,742 --> 00:00:31,910
see here, onto
a simple cylinder.

6
00:00:31,911 --> 00:00:38,690
We have used two textures here, one for the trunk

7
00:00:38,691 --> 00:00:40,213
and another for the

8
00:00:40,237 --> 00:00:42,890
cross-section of the tree trunk.

9
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,599
And I will show you in just

10
00:00:45,623 --> 00:00:47,550
a few steps how easy it

11
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,863
is to correctly place the

12
00:00:50,887 --> 00:00:53,830
texture using UV mapping.

13
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,670
We start with the Blender
Default Screen with the cube.

14
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:10,650
I delete the cube and add a cylinder,
which I scale a bit in the Z direction.

15
00:01:11,575 --> 00:01:16,850
Here, we see that we are not going to
focus

16
00:01:16,925 --> 00:01:22,630
on modeling the tree stump, but on how
we

17
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,030
can optimally map textures onto this cylinder.

18
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:35,690
Alright, now let's look at the UV Editing
tools.

19
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,190
In one of the previous tutorials, we see

20
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,250
that the cylinder is already properly mapped.

21
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,813
At this spot here,
we see here the

22
00:01:48,837 --> 00:01:52,750
side of the cylinder
and the top and

23
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:55,490
bottom of the cylinder.

24
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,710
This is the case with default objects.
