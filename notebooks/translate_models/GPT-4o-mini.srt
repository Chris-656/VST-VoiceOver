00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,550
Yes, welcome to this tutorial
in the series Texture Mapping.

2
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:24,251
This third tutorial is intended

3
00:00:24,275 --> 00:00:27,870
to show you, how to apply a

4
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:29,879
texture of a tree
trunk, which you

5
00:00:29,903 --> 00:00:31,910
see here, onto
a simple cylinder.

6
00:00:31,911 --> 00:00:35,289
We have used two textures

7
00:00:35,313 --> 00:00:38,690
here, one texture for the

8
00:00:38,691 --> 00:00:40,779
trunk and another texture here

9
00:00:40,803 --> 00:00:42,890
from the cut of the tree trunk.

10
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:45,478
And I will show you in a few

11
00:00:45,502 --> 00:00:47,550
steps how easy it is to get

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,863
the texture in the right place

13
00:00:50,887 --> 00:00:53,830
with the help of UV mapping.

14
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,670
Then let's start with the Blender
default screen here with the cube.

15
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:10,650
I delete the cube and add a
cylinder, which I scale a bit in Z.

16
00:01:11,575 --> 00:01:16,850
We see here that we will not go into
the

17
00:01:16,925 --> 00:01:19,393
modeling of the tree

18
00:01:19,417 --> 00:01:22,630
stump in detail, but only

19
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:24,098
on, how we can apply optimal

20
00:01:24,122 --> 00:01:25,030
texture to this cylinder.

21
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:35,690
Well, now let's take a
look at the UV editing tools.

22
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,190
We also see here in one of the earlier

23
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:43,108
tutorials, the cylinder is

24
00:01:43,132 --> 00:01:43,850
already properly mapped.

25
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:52,750
At this point here, we see here the
side of the cylinder and the top and

26
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:55,490
bottom of the cylinder.

27
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,710
This is the case with default objects.
