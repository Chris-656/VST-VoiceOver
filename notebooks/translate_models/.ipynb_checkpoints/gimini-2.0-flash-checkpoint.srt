00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,630
Yes, welcome to this tutorial
in the Texture Mapping series.

2
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:27,870
This third tutorial will show you how to map a texture of

3
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:31,970
a tree trunk, which you see here, onto a simple cylinder.

4
00:00:31,971 --> 00:00:35,150
We used two textures here.

5
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:42,770
One texture for the trunk and another texture
here from the cross-section of the tree trunk.

6
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:47,510
And I'll show you in just a few steps how easy it is to get

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,930
the texture in the right place here with the help of UV-Mapping.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:00,290
Then we'll start with the Blender Default
Screen.

9
00:01:00,291 --> 00:01:01,730
Here's the cube.

10
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:10,571
I delete the cube and add a
cylinder, which I scale a bit in Z.

11
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:14,492
We see here that
we won't go into

12
00:01:14,516 --> 00:01:18,080
detail about the
modeling of the tree

13
00:01:18,155 --> 00:01:22,088
trunk, but only about
how we can optimally

14
00:01:22,112 --> 00:01:25,661
map the texture
onto this cylinder.

15
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:28,000
Good.

16
00:01:28,001 --> 00:01:35,700
Now we'll take a look at the UV editing tools.

17
00:01:36,755 --> 00:01:42,260
We also see here in one of the earlier

18
00:01:42,410 --> 00:01:44,580
tutorials, the cylinder is already mapped correctly.

19
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:45,960
At this point here.

20
00:01:46,380 --> 00:01:55,681
Here we see the side of the cylinder
and the top and bottom of the cylinder.

21
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,720
That's the case with default objects.

22
00:01:58,980 --> 00:02:00,260
But let's take completely...
