Yes, welcome to this tutorial
in the series Texture Mapping.

2
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:25,674
This third tutorial is intended to show you how you can map the

3
00:00:25,698 --> 00:00:31,910
texture of a tree trunk, which you see here, onto a simple cylinder.

4
00:00:31,911 --> 00:00:37,123
We have used two textures here one texture for the

5
00:00:37,147 --> 00:00:42,890
trunk and another texture here from the cut of the tree trunk.

6
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,550
And I will show you in a few steps how easy it is to get

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,830
the texture to the right place with the help of UV mapping.

8
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,670
Then we start with the Blender Default
Screen here the cube.

9
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:10,650
I delete the cube and add a
cylinder which I scale a bit in Z.

10
00:01:11,575 --> 00:01:16,902
We see here that we are now
not going into the

11
00:01:16,926 --> 00:01:22,630
modeling of the tree stump, but only
on how we

12
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,130
can optimally map the texture onto this cylinder.

13
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:35,690
Well, we now look at the UV Editing
tools.

14
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,190
We also see here in one of the earlier

15
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,550
tutorials, the cylinder is already correctly mapped.

16
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:52,750
At this point here, we see here the
side of the cylinder and the top and

17
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:55,490
bottom of the cylinder.

18
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,710
That is the case with default objects.
