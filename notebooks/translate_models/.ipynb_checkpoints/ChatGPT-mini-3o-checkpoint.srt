00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,550
Yes, welcome to this tutorial
in the Texture Mapping series.

2
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:24,073
This third tutorial is intended

3
00:00:24,097 --> 00:00:27,870
to show you, how you can place a

4
00:00:27,871 --> 00:00:29,879
texture of a tree
trunk, which you

5
00:00:29,903 --> 00:00:31,910
see here, onto
a simple cylinder.

6
00:00:31,911 --> 00:00:34,132
We have used two textures

7
00:00:34,156 --> 00:00:37,001
here, one texture for the trunk

8
00:00:37,002 --> 00:00:39,914
and another texture here for the

9
00:00:39,938 --> 00:00:42,850
cross-section of the tree trunk.

10
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:45,408
And I will show
you in just a few

11
00:00:45,432 --> 00:00:47,550
steps how easily it is possible

12
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:50,863
to get the texture
into the right

13
00:00:50,887 --> 00:00:53,830
place with the
help of UV Mapping.

14
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,670
Then we start with the Blender
Default screen, here the cube.

15
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,026
I delete the cube and add a

16
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:10,650
cylinder, which I scale a bit in Z.

17
00:01:11,585 --> 00:01:14,826
We see here that
we will not go into

18
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:18,090
detail on the
modeling of the tree

19
00:01:18,165 --> 00:01:21,565
stump, but only on
how we can place

20
00:01:21,589 --> 00:01:25,591
an optimal texture
onto this cylinder.

21
00:01:28,040 --> 00:01:35,690
Well, let's now take a
look at the UV Editing tools.

22
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,170
We also see here, as in one of the earlier

23
00:01:42,370 --> 00:01:43,098
tutorials, that the cylinder

24
00:01:43,122 --> 00:01:43,850
is already mapped correctly.

25
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:52,750
At this point here, we see here the
side of the cylinder and the top- and

26
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:55,490
Bottom side of the cylinder.

27
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,710
This is the case with default objects.
