Welcome to this tutorial in
the series Texture Mapping.

2
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:27,910
This third tutorial is going to show
you how to make a tree trunk texture.

3
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,030
So the first thing you see here is
that you can map it to a simple cylinder.

4
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:35,170
We used two textures here.

5
00:00:35,410 --> 00:00:42,790
One texture for the trunk and
another texture here from the trunk cut.

6
00:00:43,450 --> 00:00:47,550
And I'm going to show you in
a few steps how easy that is.

7
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:53,930
The texture is then placed in the right
place with the help of the UV mapping.

8
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:01,730
Then we start with the Blender
Default screen, here's the cube.

9
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:10,690
I erase the cube and add a cylinder
to it, which I scale a little bit in Z.

10
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:16,910
We see here that we are not here
now closer to the modelling of the

11
00:01:16,911 --> 00:01:22,730
The main objective of this project
is to improve the quality of the

12
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,130
I can map cylinders.

13
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:35,770
Okay, let's look at
the UV editing tools.

14
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:44,010
We see here in one of the earlier tutorials,
the cylinder is already mapped correctly.

15
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:49,785
At this point here, we
see here the side of the

16
00:01:49,809 --> 00:01:55,490
Cylinders and the top
and bottom of the cylinder.

17
00:01:56,440 --> 00:01:58,730
That's the case
with default objects.

18
00:01:59,330 --> 00:02:00,610
But if we turn
around completely,
