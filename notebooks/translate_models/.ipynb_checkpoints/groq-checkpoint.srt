00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:19,430
Yes, a warm welcome to this tutorial
in the series Texture Mapping.

2
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:27,730
This third tutorial is supposed to show you, how you can apply

3
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,750
a texture of a tree trunk, which you see here, to a simple cylinder.

4
00:00:31,751 --> 00:00:34,990
We have used two textures here.

5
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:42,590
One texture for the trunk and another
texture from the cut of the tree trunk.

6
00:00:43,310 --> 00:00:47,370
And I will show you in a few short steps, how easy it is to

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,670
get the texture to the right place with the help of UV-Mapping.

8
00:00:55,015 --> 00:01:00,030
Then we start with the Blender default
screen.

9
00:01:00,510 --> 00:01:01,510
Here is the cube.

10
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:10,430
I delete the cube and add a
cylinder, which I scale a bit in Z.

11
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:14,843
We see here that
we are not going into

12
00:01:14,867 --> 00:01:18,130
the details of modeling
the tree stump,

13
00:01:18,155 --> 00:01:21,861
but only into how we
can map the texture

14
00:01:21,885 --> 00:01:25,591
onto this cylinder
in an optimal way.

15
00:01:27,285 --> 00:01:35,450
Alright, we now look at the UV editing
tools.

16
00:01:36,755 --> 00:01:43,670
We also saw in one of the earlier tutorials
that the cylinder is already correctly mapped.

17
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:49,735
At this point here, we
see the side of

18
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:55,370
Cylinders and the top
and the underside of the cylinder.

19
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,410
This is the case with default objects.
