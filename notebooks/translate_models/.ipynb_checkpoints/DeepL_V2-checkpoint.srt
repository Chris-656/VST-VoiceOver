00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:19,590
Yes, welcome to this tutorial
in the Dexter Mepping series.

2
00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:27,910
This third tutorial will show you
how you can center a texture of

3
00:00:27,950 --> 00:00:32,010
a tree trunk, which you see
here, on a simple cylinder. cylinder.

4
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:37,144
We have used two textures
here used here, one texture for the

5
00:00:37,244 --> 00:00:42,890
trunk and another texture here
from the cut of the tree trunk.

6
00:00:43,300 --> 00:00:47,190
And I'll show you in a few steps
how easy it is to get the texture in

7
00:00:47,191 --> 00:00:54,511
the right place with the help of UV
mapping. with the help of UV mapping.

8
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:01,730
Then we start with the Blender
Diefold screen here the cube.

9
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:05,919
I delete the cube,
I add a cylinder

10
00:01:05,943 --> 00:01:10,650
to it, which I
scale a little in Z.

11
00:01:11,575 --> 00:01:18,130
We can see here that we are not going
to the modeling of the tree stump, but only

12
00:01:18,155 --> 00:01:25,631
how we can optimally center the texture
on this cylinder. texture to this cylinder.

13
00:01:28,020 --> 00:01:35,670
All right, let's take a look
at the UV editing tools.

14
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:40,482
We also see here in one of
the earlier tutorials that the

15
00:01:40,483 --> 00:01:46,070
cylinder is already correctly
mapped at this point here.

16
00:01:47,780 --> 00:01:55,530
Here we see the side of the cylinder
and the underside of the cylinder.

17
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:59,970
This is the case with diefold
objects, even if we completely...
