Welcome to this tutorial in
the series Texture Mapping.

2
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:27,830
This third tutorial is intended to show you, how you can map a

3
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:29,653
texture of a tree
trunk, which you

4
00:00:29,677 --> 00:00:31,810
can see here, onto
a simple cylinder.

5
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:35,050
We have used two textures here.

6
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:42,690
One texture for the trunk and another
texture here from the cut of the tree trunk.

7
00:00:42,770 --> 00:00:47,430
And I will show you in just a few steps, how easy this is possible,

8
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:50,803
here to get the
texture to the right

9
00:00:50,827 --> 00:00:53,750
place with the
help of UV mapping.

10
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,650
Then we start with the Blender Default
Screen, here the cube.

11
00:01:02,100 --> 00:01:10,470
I delete the cube and add a
cylinder, which I scale a little in Z.

12
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:16,790
We see here that we are not approaching the modeling of the tree

13
00:01:16,791 --> 00:01:20,355
stump here now, but
only on how we can

14
00:01:20,379 --> 00:01:24,910
optimally map the
texture onto this cylinder.

15
00:01:26,110 --> 00:01:34,630
Good, we now look at the 
UV-Mapping-Modellierungen.

16
00:01:36,765 --> 00:01:43,970
We see here also in one of the earlier
Tutorials, is the cylinder already correctly mapped.

17
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:49,741
At this point here, we see here the side of the

18
00:01:49,765 --> 00:01:55,370
cylinder and the top and the bottom of the cylinder.

19
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,610
That is the case with default objects.

20
00:01:58,770 --> 00:01:59,850
If we however
