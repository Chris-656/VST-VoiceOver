00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:19,550
Yes, welcome to this tutorial in the series Texture Mapping.

2
00:00:20,270 --> 00:00:25,674
This third tutorial should show you how to apply a texture of

3
00:00:25,698 --> 00:00:31,910
a tree trunk, which you can see here, onto a simple cylinder.

4
00:00:31,911 --> 00:00:37,123
We have used two textures here, one for the

5
00:00:37,147 --> 00:00:42,890
trunk and another texture for the cut of the tree trunk.

6
00:00:43,430 --> 00:00:47,550
And I will show you in a few simple steps how easy it is to

7
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:53,830
place the texture in the right position with the help of UV mapping.

8
00:00:55,820 --> 00:01:01,670
Then we start with the Blender Default Screen, here the cube.

9
00:01:02,350 --> 00:01:10,650
I delete the cube and add a cylinder, which I scale a bit in Z.

10
00:01:11,575 --> 00:01:16,902
We see here that we will not go into the

11
00:01:16,926 --> 00:01:22,630
modeling of the tree stump in detail, but

12
00:01:23,080 --> 00:01:25,330
only on how to apply optimal texture to this cylinder.

13
00:01:26,740 --> 00:01:35,690
Alright, let's now look at the UV Editing Tools.

14
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:42,190
We also see here that in one of the previous

15
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:44,550
tutorials, the cylinder is already correctly mapped.

16
00:01:44,870 --> 00:01:52,750
At this point here, we see the
side of the cylinder and the top and

17
00:01:52,875 --> 00:01:55,490
bottom of the cylinder.

18
00:01:56,410 --> 00:01:58,710
This is the case with default objects.
